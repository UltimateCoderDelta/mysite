    <h2>Why We Chose AI for Healthcare</h2>
    <p>
      Healthcare and medicine are one of the most vital aspects of human civilization. Throughout the centuries, and most recently, medicine has
      allowed humanity to achieve wonders the likes of which were unheard of in ages of old; we were able to discover cures for the most life-threathening
      of diseases such as - but not limited to - Cholera, Malaria, and more recently, Covid-19. The aforementioned examples mark a minor percentage
      of the total amount of illnesses humanity has successfully been able to overcome. However, the fight for a healthier species is still far out of reach.
      Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, and more specifically, machine learning, have - and 
      will continue to - catalyze medical breakthroughs. Our mission therefore, is to be a part of that future; a world where we as a species can thrive,
      knowing that we have successfully found the cure to most, if not all, viral, bacterial, and cancerous illnesses. 
    </p>
    <p>
      At it's core, DeepNeural is, in its current state, a start-up project seeking to develop a plethora of machine learning models - ranging
      from classical ML models (tabular), to natural language and computer vision - with the goal of aiding medical professionals and their respective patients,
      ensuring faster diagnostics of various illnesses, to promote a greater well-being for those who are truly in need in a quick period of time; nothing is more
      important than the health of a patient, and DeepNeural seeks to work with that statement in mind.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This however, is not where this project for better healthcare meets a halt; the healthcare sector provides a great amount of flexibility for
      expansion; medical robotics, assistive chatbots for mental well-being and neural interfaces capable of providing those individuals who are paraplegic,
      the ability to live their lives to the fullest once more; this is DeepNeural's overall vision, and although the project is still in its infancy,
      that vision, will be attained. Humanity's health, happiness, and prosperity is our top priority.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Machine Learning for Healthcare?</h2>
    <p>
      The healthcare sector is a complex field with a plethora of challenges which must be solved on a daily basis, with 
      vast amounts of documentation requirements, and a limited amount of patient care options. Due to this nature, AI
      has the potential to enhance and streamline certain processes within the sector, such as
      medical imaging, patient sentiment analysis, early disease detection, and medical documentation 
      summarization,  through novel predictive and text-based deep learning models. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, it must be recognized that, although many progressive organizations and leaders in healthcare
      are open to adopting AI technologies and applications, there are concerns with respect to their use, as all
      technologies have their pros and cons; in the case of AI in healthcare, the issues arrive due to the lack of
      data, or in other cases, the complexity of said data. DeepNeural understands these issues, and is determined 
      to work as carefully as possible to ensure that the models we create, adhere to as many medical standards as
      possible. However, even with certain setbacks, we are confident in our ability to achieve and provide, for a better,
      healthier future. 
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Horizon Grand View Research statistics, AI in healthcare is set to expand
      exponentially in the near future, as evidenced by the chart displayed below. Due to this
      segment of information, it is now clear that AI, and its potential will continously expand
      as the technology evolves.

     <h2>DeepNeural's Mission</h2>
     <p>
       In the last section, we discussed the potential of AI in healthcare, and what the purpose of DeepNeural is; 
       however, the primary mission must further be ellaborated on. Our mission is the following:
     </p>
     <q>
      We seek to revolutionize healthcare by using cutting-edge
      AI to accelerate diagnoses, enhance clinical decision-making,
      and support ongoing health management. Through innovative AI-driven
      solutions, we will contribute to advancements in medical robotics,
      drug discovery, and the promotion of human longevity, making these technologies
      accessible to healthcare professionals and patients alike.
      </q>
     <h2>Our Vision of a Healthier Future</h2>
     <p>
      To create a future where AI-powered healthcare
      technologies, from diagnostics to medical robotics,
      are seamlessly integrated into the healthcare ecosystem,
      improving patient outcomes and extending human longevity.
      We envision a world where advanced health solutions are 
      universally accessible and pave the way for a healthier,
      longer life for all.
